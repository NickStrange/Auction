A Quieting

A vibrant sky retreats, 
deep hues awaken,
trees take on a blackness that cools the air,
challenging the warmth of my flesh. 
A quieting and slowness 
overtake the bustle and din of the day. 
My heartbeat synchronizes to the rhythm. 
My mind pauses, holds the moment, 
exists only in the moment. 
A smile begins deep in my breast, 
reaches to touch my face, 
to shine outward, to expose itself, 
to reflect the world I am in.
