Anticipation 

The rise and fall of her chest noticeably hastened its pace,
betraying her,
expressing her desire,
insinuating at the wild racing of her thoughts
and how torrid they were. 
It did not go unnoticed, 
but he said nothing. 
He simply cupped her chin, lifted her face to meet his eyes,
and smiled at her. 
Then he leaned to press his mouth to the side of her face, 
giving her one gentle kiss to the cheek,
then upwards,
then down.
When their lips met she was all fire, in full blaze,
and he drew her to him,
wrapping his arms round.
