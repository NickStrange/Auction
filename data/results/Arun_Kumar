Learning
I've learned that, no matter what happens, how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.
I've learned that I can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles 4 things:
a rainy day, the elderly, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.
I've learned that making a 'living' is not the same thing as making a 'life.'
I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second (or third, or fourth) chance. 
I've learned that if I pursue happiness, it will elude me but, if I focus on family, friends, the needs of others and doing the very best I can, happiness finds me.
I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, its usually the right decision.
I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.
I've learned to reach out to touch someone every day. People love a human touch.
I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.
Happy Christmas to all!
Seductions are not always wrapped in silk and candlelight, in a tangling of limbs, sweat and moans.
If a man can leave himself in your mind, fixed and unmoving, as if making himself at home,
if he can cause you to pause, to ruminate on all aspects of his being-
his voice as well as his words, his movements and mannerisms as well as his actions, his kindnesses and thoughtfulness as well as his sexuality,
if thoughts of him can bring a rush of warmth to your cheeks and a heightening to the rise and fall of your breast even as you go about the most mundane of daily tasks, the most ordinary living,
if he has become part of your every day even when he is not, 
he has seduced you, more than body.
He has seduced your very existence, your very essence.
