As I Am

You took me in your arms
you embraced my nakedness
rawness
all the damage I no longer tried to hide
you took the ugliness
and the beauty
the hatred and the love
venom, vice, virtue
wounds and salve
all the parts combined
that made me whole
all the parts as one
without picking or choosing
without sifting, filtering
telling me to change, to polish
to perfect
you took me as I am
in my entirety.
