Bellissime Imagine

My Own Being
As a girl I dreamed the fairy tale
of being swept off my feet
rescued
from an ordinary life, alone
caught in the dizzying spin
of love, romance
As I moved from girl to woman reality stripped bare the tale
and I saw the world and all its men
for what they are
not shining knights or princes primed
to carry me off into ever-after
but no different than I
no more and no less
and not necessary for my only happiness
Now fully into my womanhood
I carry my own sword 
and no longer dream
but make my life happen 
with goals and ambitions
champion of my own being
