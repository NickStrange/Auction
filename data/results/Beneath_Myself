Beneath Myself

I am layered beneath myself
lift the surface, the seen
and you are closer to the root
Another layer peeled away
and I am there, 
but still distant
half-formed of who I am, my truth
half what the world has placed upon
for me to blend, survive
Strip me down to the core
you will find what you fear to know
and what I fear to reveal
for how naked, raw, pure
is the heart, the soul
the depth beneath the surface
