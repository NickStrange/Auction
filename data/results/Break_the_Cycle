Break the Cycle

Be the person who breaks the cycle.
If you were judged, choose understanding. 
If you were rejected, choose acceptance
If you were shamed, choose compassion
Be the person you needed when you were hurting, not the person who hurt you
Vow to be better than what broke you - to heal instead of becoming bitter so you can act from your heart, not your pain
