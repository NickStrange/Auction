But Come Alive

There is ultimate freedom
and bliss
in knowing who you are
in knowing what you want
and making your dreams
more than just come true
but come alive
through your own effort
your own grit
your own diligence
persistence
belief in your abilities 
and your eventual mastery
of challenges, obstacles
setbacks and doubt
