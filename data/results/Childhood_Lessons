Childhood Lessons

In time I learned
that it made no difference
that I loved
passionately
eagerly
and with total commitment
because I loved without effect
and though that was never
the goal
to create an outcome
it was the hope
that what I gave
would be returned
not as tit for tat
but as result of my own worth
I did not know
that it was foolish 
to hope to be loved
and wanted
as much as it blazed
within my own heart
but all that I did not know
in time 
I learned
as childhood passed
