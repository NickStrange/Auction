Closer

I bring myself closer
to where
to who
I want to be
every time
I pause
before I speak
every time
I act
after I think
reining in
my impulses
urges
and immediate 
supposed needs
giving time
to assess
to weigh
to wonder
what is the best
or the right
or the most
beneficial
of all the different
choices
that lay before me
this is when
I bring myself closer
to what
to all
I deserve to be
