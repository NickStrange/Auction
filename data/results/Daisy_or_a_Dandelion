Daisy or a Dandelion

She wasn't the type to wait 
for a man to give her flowers.  
She satisfied her own wants, needs, 
interest, and curiosities.  
She gave herself the love she desired 
and on ocassion, 
picked herself a daisy or a dandelion, 
a sunflower or a rose, 
freshly blossomed.  
More often, though, 
she tilled a garden 
and planted the seeds.
