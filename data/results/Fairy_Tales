Fairy Tales 

I heard stories when I was a little girl,
stories that ended with happily-ever-after.  
Not all of the stories were fairy tales;
a few were real.  
When I grew up I wanted to be 
one of the few.  
In a way I was, but it took time 
for me to realize that sometimes
happily-ever-after 
is when you break free.  
And, every happy ending, whether 
youve found Prince Charming 
or escaped from him, 
is something that you make for yourself.
