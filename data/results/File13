My greatest battle is not in remaining strong, finding courage, being willing or able to fight,

but in remaining open, vulnerable.
I can be ready for any war, any challenge, swallow any pain.
But I am terrified equally of how my vulnerability marks me a target and how, without it, I have no chance at fully living life.
