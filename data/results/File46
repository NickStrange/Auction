I spoke to him recently, after the coarseness and the hardened edge of our ending had softened into something malleable --malleable, but into what form I was not yet sure.  Speaking to him decided that for me.  Even after the passage of time he would not own up to his lies.  He tried to convince me I'd misunderstood him, that I was mistaken about all the stories he'd repeatedly told me.  He tried to turn my mind, to make me question my own memory.  He was incapable of truth, of decency, of simply taking responsibility for his own choices and mistakes.  He wanted to make them mine.  And, for no purpose other than his image, his pride.  Though full grown he was incapable of being man rather than boy.  

I am a woman with no interest in nor respect for boys.
