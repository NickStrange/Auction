Others sought my love, then treated me in a way that lost, not only my love, but also my respect.  

They lacked the character that I sought alongside love, the character I also expect of myself.  They did not value my respect.  
I know now not to listen to men who merely speak of love.  I paid attention to a man of character who sought, earned, and values my respect.
