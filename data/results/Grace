Grace

Someone told me once that I had grace under pressure and a talent for tackling hardship without letting emotion affect me.  
They meant it as a compliment, were impressed with how I handled a difficult series of situations.  They didn't know me well.  
Life indoctrinated me from childhood, hard life, nothing easy.  It isn't the absence of emotion or an excess of grace that I possess.  
It's the ability to compartmentalize.  I feel the pain and fear and anguish, whatever emotion is at hand, and I feel it all in excess.  
Grace leaves me entirely.  But, none of that seems to show on the outside.  I am well trained, well practiced, not in the art of disguise, but in prioritizing how and when I deal with each matter.  
The problem is always first and the emotions tumble after, most often when I am alone.  That is when I fall apart.  
That is when I cry and scream.  That is when I beg and moan. Alone.
There is no grace in me.
