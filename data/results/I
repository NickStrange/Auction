I

have found, more often than not, 
that brokenness enlarges the heart.  
The broken pull love from within.
They tap into the well, because they have not received what they need from the outside.
And what they draw out, instead of holding onto it, they give it away.  
Broken people are not greedy, 
but generous with their love.
