I've lost a piece of who I am 

and who I was, 
part of my identity.  
It happens every time with loss,
through death 
and the end of intimacies.  
When people leave, 
they take me with them.  
But so, too, do they stay.  
I lose a piece, a part, 
but retain some of who they are 
and who they were, 
part of their identity.  
It's a different kind of give and take.
