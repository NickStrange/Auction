I Believe in You

And it was that sudden,
the shift,
the whole world no longer spinning out of control. 
Her heart leapt,
danced,
and broke the rhythm,
escaping its ribbed cage and
flying free,
flying fast.
The fears gone. 
The nightmare not real. 
Chaos would not reign. 
There was order restored to her world,
her future. 
Joy, acceptable again;
she took it in,
all barriers to its gifts
stripped away in that instant. 
No words spoken
were ever as life-changing,
as beautiful, or
as needed.
