In Rhythm

How great the peace that comes
when there is no fear
no lack of trust
no absence of believing
that this man will stand beside
never waver in his love, his loyalty
his promise-
his integrity and character more powerful
than any temptation or thinning wear of time
his respect for me greater than his lust
his tenderness equal to his strength
his soul, entwined
his heart synchronized in rhythm to mine
