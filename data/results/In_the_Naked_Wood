In the Naked Wood

Outside the constructs of man
in the naked wood, the open field
the wild jungle
I escape and disappear
becoming one with the world as it is
when untouched, unchanged
lacking all of man's manipulations
I blend
I absorb
I walk into myself, into the height of my living
tall as the redwood
deep as the winding root
free 
as the air, as the sky
as the water running soft in the creek
wild in the river
and raging, roaring
in the open sea
