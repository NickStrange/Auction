Instead of Lover

He speaks
sometimes with sincerity 
sometimes with calculated deception 
and I am tired of the chore
defiant against the task
resistant to the demand 
that I be detective instead of lover
I do not want a chameleon 
instead of a man
changing his colors to fit the scene
a nightmare pretending to be a dream
