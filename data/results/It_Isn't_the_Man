It Isn't the Man

It isn't the man
who spins the web
who lives steeped in deceit
focused solely
on narcissistic, self-absorbed
unfeeling personal release
It isn't the man
so full of guile
with tricks and lies
who takes as he wishes
casts you aside without a care
burns you for no reason
just because you are there
It isn't the man
It is the coward, the cad
the unscrupulous man-child 
who hides behind the disguise
of being honorable and good
in other's
and even his own eyes
