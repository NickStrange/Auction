Spare Parts 
When I put the pieces back, 
there were more;
pieces that were not me,
that had not been there before. 
As I placed them, what formed
was a whole new me;
a me made of more than me, 
some parts were you, 
or because of you.
A new fortitude,
reserves,
for the future days 
when I might fall to pieces again.
