Lifetime Scars
The pain lingers, though its birth lies deep in the past.
Shudders and vibrations.
The prick of a memory opening the scar, 
baring the raw,
the uneven recovery.
Her hands upon me, cruel, rough.
Her mouth a screaming monster.
My body her captive, bound without chain.  
Her mind the knotted rope twisting my thoughts.
Me not knowing
the difference between
what is real
and what is an unholy make-believe?
