Against the Wind
Sometimes, you just have to go against the wind.  Let the determination overtake you, that pull testing your strength and making your fight come alive.  It can make you willful, like a child, insistent to match or beat that opposing force.  
When something you want seems impossible or unlikely, don't give in or give up.  Go against the wind.
