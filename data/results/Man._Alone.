Man. Alone.

Beneath the many layers of his strength
and his masculine energy.
Beneath his towering presence
his accomplishments
and his abilities.
Beneath all the ways in which he proves
and earns his name
his place.
Beneath the certainty and the diligence
the largeness of who he is
and who he wishes to become.
There is the small
the diminutive
the doubts.
The helplessness
the limits and bindings.
That he
Man. Alone.  

Fears are the real
beneath the false.
