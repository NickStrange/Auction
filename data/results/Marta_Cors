All At Once
I stopped wishing for what I didn't have 
-and who.  
I stopped wishing to be different, 
or the same.  
I stopped wishing for a changed past 
and the future it would have made.  
I stopped wishing I hadn't made mistakes.  
I stopped wishing I was more than I am.  
I stopped wishing, regretting, replaying, 
and envying.  
I stopped wishing, wanting 
anything 
but who I am 
and what I have, 
in this moment.  
I stopped- 
and, all at once, 
finally, 
at last...
I began.
