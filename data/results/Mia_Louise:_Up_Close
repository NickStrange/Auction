Mia Louise: Up Close

Not In Part
But that was the thing... to love him was to lose too much of me.  
He wanted so little of love.  
I had far more to give.  
And not to give it would be to waste it, 
to waste portions of my life, 
for my loving was the best of my living.  
It satisfied my soul's yearnings, longings,
its needs.
I wanted the man who poured more into my soul, 
not the one who took from it. 
I wanted the man who gloried in the giving, 
of both his love and my own.  
I wanted the love that matched mine, valued mine, 
that cherished the way I love, 
not in part but in whole.
