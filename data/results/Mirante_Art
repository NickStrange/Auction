Mirante Art

Drawn
She was drawn to a man she could look up to, admire. 
She was drawn to a man with integrity 
and a motivating, but not all-consuming ambition. 
She didn't fall for good looks and a jaw-dropping physique. 
She noticed them, 
always, 
but they weren't enough to make her swoon. 
A man had to have more than a handsome face 
to hold her attention. He had to be kind, 
and he had to be strong, of character. 
She wanted a decisive man, 
one whose judgment she could fully trust, 
but who would listen to her own. 
She wanted a man who valued her input, her mind. 
She wanted sincerity and loyalty, 
a man who valued honesty. 
And she sought passion, 
wanting a fire to their love, 
a fire that could be sustained. 
All together, she wanted a man in whom she'd be proud 
and eager to walk beside in life, 
a man who could represent her to the world 
and who she could proudly represent in return.
