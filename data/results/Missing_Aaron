Missing Aaron 

What adds to the difficulty in coming back from sadness when our hearts are broken is that we've lost some of ourselves inside the loss of another. 
We give pieces of our happiness away to those we trust and love, pieces of our joy, our soul, our very selves. 
When we are abandoned, or worse, when someone dies, they take that with them. We lose them, the pieces of us they held, and the joy that was forever attached.  
We're left fragmented and it is impossible to piece back together what isn't lost, but gone.
