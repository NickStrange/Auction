Patterns

It altered my mind, my thinking
and understanding of reality
to be toyed with so young
mind games
I did not recognize that they were threats
to keep me quiet
to keep me from telling
I did not recognize that they were lies
terrifying lies
that shaped my childhood
that shaped the growth
of my young mind
creating pathways of thought, reactions 
to fear
that were insensible, illogical
irrational
I did not recognize that I was victimized
I did not recognize that I was
not alone
I only saw the false reality she created
I never saw the puppet master's strings
making me be and live and do
what dhe wanted me to
Until I grew
Then I saw through the trickery
the mind games, threats, lies
I recognized the patterns that had been set
patterns I work with diligence
to undo
