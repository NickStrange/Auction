Perception of Mind

I had come to believe that I was unfixable, 
too damaged and dinged, 
beyond hope for wholeness of being.  

I traced back the belief to its origin, its root, 
to where the seed was planted.  
Then I examined in reverse how it grew.  
It had not been placed by me. The belief was not my own.  
It was not formed of my own mind, 
but given, 
handed down from another 
whose trade was to plant rotted seeds, 
water them with filth
to grow steely, clawed roots.  
It was a poison offered as elixir, 
a way to twist and distort a life beautiful
a way to take away what lives
and replace it with what dies, 
a way to alter perception of mind
to be cruel, evil
instead of loving, kind.
I saw the truth with my retracing.
I saw the truth that being unfixable
was her truth,
not mine.
