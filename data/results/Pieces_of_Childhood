Pieces of Childhood 

I let go of yesterday
Slowly letting it fall
I did not release it
all at once
but in stages
At first
just enough
to carry on
then more
I distanced myself
with the time
that is supposed to heal
Until one day
I found
that I was done
The pace
made it bearable
To shed pieces of it
one by one
not rushing it
made it easier
to move on
