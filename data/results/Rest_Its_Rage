Rest Its Rage

When will the world rest its rage
lay it aside and just live
without condemning others to die
without condemning others
period
When will the world raise its head
no longer hanging low
and live up to its worth
up to its potential
When will the world stop the dead
the murders and killing
when will it stop the hate
the horror
When will the world demand virtue
demand love
of itself
of its future
of its present
and learn from its past
