Running on Empty

Im feeling a bit emptied out. 
I suppose its wrong to say a bit'. 
Thats me trying to minimize 
a maximum feeling, 
to downplay, to reduce. 
There's fear in showing full vulnerability,
expressing the real weight of emotion.
It's easier -or 
viewed as more acceptable 
to water it down. 
Maybe it's a tactic, 
an attempt to lessen the feeling 
by expressing it as less, 
a way to trick my own mind. 
I'm not sure 
whether I'm trying to fool others 
or myself 
when I say I feel 
a bit emptied out.
I am running on empty.
