Sacrifice or Surrender 

You cannot climb the mountain without dislodging a stone.  Your triumphs will not come easy, without loss or sacrifice.  If you let a setback immobilize you, you will only ever be halfway.  Decide which you want, part or the whole, and accept what comes with your decision -sacrifice or surrender.
