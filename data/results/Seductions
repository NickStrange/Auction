Seductions

Seductions are not always wrapped in silk and candlelight, in a tangling of limbs, sweat and moans.
If a man can leave himself in your mind, fixed and unmoving, as if making himself at home,
if he can cause you to pause, to ruminate on all aspects of his being-
his voice as well as his words, his movements and mannerisms as well as his actions, his kindnesses and thoughtfulness as well as his sexuality,
if thoughts of him can bring a rush of warmth to your cheeks and a heightening to the rise and fall of your breast even as you go about the most mundane of daily tasks, the most ordinary living,
if he has become part of your every day even when he is not, 
he has seduced you, more than body.
He has seduced your very existence, your very essence.
