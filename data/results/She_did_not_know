She did not know 

That grace could touch her
So settled in her strength 
And wild
Her ferocity
That gentle hand or gentle touch
All tenderness and blessing
Seemed a too distant memory
A thing behind, gone
Its time spent
And her beyond its reach
Yet here it was
Caressing kind
A kiss upon her fire
Not gone, not spent
Only waiting
For deliverance
