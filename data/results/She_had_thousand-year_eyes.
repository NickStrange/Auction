She had thousand-year eyes. 

They touched upon me for all of five seconds but they stayed with me for months afterward.
A man she would never meet had donated her clothing, 
three sizes too big but they kept her warm and hid her slimness, now just another shapeless figure among the shapeless mass here, in the semi-dark on one of humanities lost forgotten edges.
