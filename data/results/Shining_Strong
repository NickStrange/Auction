Shining Strong

I thought I knew
where sunshine grew
beneath the shallows
of skin and bone
not in our hearts
but farther 
closer
within our souls
I was certain
that it was planted there
a seed
for us to grow
but I was wrong
and see that now
I had the where
I had that all along
but there is no seed
to start us off
we are the sun
the light
shining strong
from the moment
we are born
it is age
experience
the perspectives
we twist
removing us
from youth
that dulls
and withers
what was born fully grown
