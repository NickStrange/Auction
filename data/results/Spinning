Spinning

When the sky darkens and my world becomes 
thick with shadows
I turn the misery, the fear,
the gloom and sorrow
into an art, a dance, 
a song,
a celebration- 
spinning the coin of life-death, 
good-evil, joy-pain,
right-wrong
spinning and spinning
changing it round
until I am out of breath
