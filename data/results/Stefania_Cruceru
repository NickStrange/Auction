The Legacy
.My grandmother was a poet, too.
She kept it to herself, locked inside
and rarely let it out.
But it was alive in her, as the breath she inhaled
the stirring of her soul.
She'd speak and sing and 
I would imagine, think
lyrically, poetically
with a beauty touching her mind
from the inside.
And she wrote.  No.  She composed.
She composed words as if they were her symphony.
She pulled from her heart
played its strings, softly, lovingly
or with vigor, with power, strength.
But in her life, she lived for others.
She lived outside of her dreams
without setting her soul free.
Her compositions, her art
were set aside
and she kept locked their cage
never turned the key.
I am my grandmother's child 
having inherited that key
but halfway through my life
unlike my grandmother
I turned it
I pressed it to the lock
pushed and turned and opened.
I could not live without my dreams
the legacy from my grandmother calling
calling, screaming
I had to speak and live loud
my poetry.
