The Distance Needed

I created the distance needed
to become an observer
to watch the unfolding
of my letting go
to watch the release, away, gone
of all that had done harm
all that caused me pain
even the roots were dug up
pulled from the soil
every last one unfixed, undone
It was the unlearning
of bad seeds planted in me
the undoing
of what never should have been made
and though life had grown it tall, strong
I watched, observing, distant
as new life carried off the weight
and I cared not, thought not, worried not
where it would go
it was no longer part of me
no longer my home
