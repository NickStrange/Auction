The Fervor 

Youth is now memory
tucked inside my years of living
pushed to the back
a dusty corner
that requires maintaining, tending
if I am to recall, to bring back
undamaged 
its most precious expression 
-not the visage, smooth, unmarked
but the fervor with which I once believed 
in the noble heart of humanity
