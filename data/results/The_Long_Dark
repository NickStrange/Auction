The Long Dark 

I pull inward during winter.  
Perhaps my bones remember the lives 
of ancestors dead for millennia, 
who drew to fire in dank caves
and buried themselves beneath thick fur.
Or I am sensitive to the long dark 
and how it clouds the mind, 
placing a shadow over joy 
until sprouts push through the ice 
and buds form on skeletal branches .
