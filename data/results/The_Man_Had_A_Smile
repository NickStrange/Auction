The Man Had A Smile

The man had a smile
that could melt a women's heart
a sweet way about him
that would make any woman swoon
hands that could have a lady's
mind running wild
eyes that penetrated
the desire behind 
her own baby blues
a voice
that would make her 
forget her own name 
a gentleman
of the finest kind
enthralling charm
albeit more importantly 
he touched her heart
speaking a language of love
only her soul could read
and together they created 
a lifetime of poetry
