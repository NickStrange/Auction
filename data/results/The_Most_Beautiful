The Most Beautiful

It changes with time
what we are attracted to
what we deem beautiful
We lose the blinders
that keep us from full vision
that keep us from seeing truth
Time gives us freedom
from youthful folly
from youthful judgment
We gain perspective
and with it, the most beautiful
the most satisfying life
