The Sad Ones

Her story was one of 
the sad ones. 
She'd loved, 
with fury and madness, 
with all of her soul. 
She'd loved 
with a passion 
that rivaled the most infamous 
sinners 
and revered saints. 
She'd loved 
completely 
and without guile, 
with an innocence, 
and with faith. 
She'd loved 
until the end, 
and even past, 
into the darkness beyond, 
when her heart had turned 
to stone 
and she was left to wander 
in a fog of loneliness 
hearing only echoes 
of his promises 
and feeling only the cold 
of his absence, 
no longer seeing light, 
only black-
the happiest of endings
kept from her
forever to remain
untold.
