The Seeker

I trod a path not unusual, 
with no greatness to it, 
no yellow bricks or gold paving.  
I did not pass through a looking glass to find it 
nor was it less travelled. 
It was well worn, 
fixed on the land, 
without a hint of 
the fantastic or philosophical about it.
It was common.  
But upon this path I found my way, 
not the way of all the others who'd tread before me, 
wearing in the ruts, 
flattening the soil.  
I found that it is not the path 
that is unusual, 
fantastic, 
or philosophical.  
And it is not the place.
It is the pathfinder, 
the seeker in search of the way.  
We make life what we are.  
We need not seek adventure 
to find it.  
We need not seek a Wonderland or hide-a-way 
to experience what such places have to offer.  
Wherever we go, we are the traveler, 
the one who brings life 
to the place, 
to the path, 
to the journey.  
The roots of magic, 
contentment, 
peace 
lie not in the way 
or the where, 
but in the who, 
in the seeker.
