The Turnaround 

We often mistake
what hurts
or stings
as an unwelcome
or unwanted
happening
but if we just wait
we are likely to see
a turnaround
something sour
or bitter
that turns sweet
an ending
that is a far cry
from what went awry
along the way
we make a guess
at what we want
and we try
for what we think
we need
but we forget 
to trust
in the winding path
of our destiny-
what is right
and good for us
is what life
with its twists and turns
will bring.
