There are countless life stories, 

tragedies, 
romance, 
comedy, 
adventure
mystery, 
horror, and the dramatic 
Lives that were taken too soon, ventured too long, 
and all the variances in between. 
But all carry the same message, the same moral, 
the same lesson:
However it is lived, 
life is not meant to be wasted.
