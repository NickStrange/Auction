Through Me 

I did not know love
I knew the quickening beats
when taking in the stretch of his smile
and how rich the laughter that came from his lips
I knew the pleasure, the ecstasy
of seeing the light in his eyes
when he felt joy
and the softening, the gentle look
when he was thinking, remembering
or imagining
times spent with ones he loved
It need not be me, but his son
his daughter, his father, his mother -long passed
any such memory
that lifted his heart and stroked its center
giving him his own
quickening beats
I did not know love
I had become love
because his love 
was moving through me
