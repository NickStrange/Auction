To Teach Us

Time is a warrior
with unmatched endurance
It fights the war
ceaselessly, never tiring
or pausing to rest
Always in motion
Always in play
Unconquerable:
It serves to teach us
that we too must endure,
remain in motion, be at the ready
to battle on
no matter what pain, what injury,
what test
