To Truly Live

What I want is an ordinary life filled with extraordinary experiences.  
I want to learn this world and its people.  I want to know and understand what is different from me.  I want to step outside my comfort zone.  
I want to live freely and love madly.  I want to stretch my existence as much as I can, to expand and never contract.  
I don't want to run from what I'm afraid of, but to seek it out, with caution.  I want to be brave and bold.  
I want to share all I have to offer and accept what I am given.  I want to move forward and to avoid hesitations that don't serve or assist me, to avoid that which only delays.  
I want my life to be a constant lesson, a journey, an exploration and celebration.  I want to appreciate this gift and do justice to both its magnitude and impermanence.  I want to truly live.
