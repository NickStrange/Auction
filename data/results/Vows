Vows

When I am in despair, drifting
You are there
As beacon, as anchor, as moor
Lifes grief and trials are not met
Alone
I am comforted, consoled
Supported
My hunger for love met 
In the steadiness of your arms 
The steel of your gaze
Locking, holding
Centering my search
You are the trust alive
Beating in my heart
You are the fire, eternal
My heart flame
Offering warmth
Providing light
Giving
Your affections indelible
Printed upon
Blended 
Your love to mine
Your promise
Your vow
Your name
