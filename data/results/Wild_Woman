Wild Woman

And through it all
the joys and the pain
she is there
the woman who becomes your sister
who becomes your bright star 
your gift from the universe
your fellow wild woman 
with gypsy heart that dances 
to the same rhythm
your fellow wild woman
with shared soul that knows 
without needing to be told
your wild sister friend
the woman who will love you
support you
your equal in giving
until forever
then even after
