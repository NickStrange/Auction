Without you

I am cold without you
despite the warmth of the season
my arms and my body are empty
the bed, unturned, orderly
without the chaos of love
tearing apart its sheets
and my heart is missing beats
languoring, dawdling , taking its time
uneager to pace its rhythm
as it does when you are here.
