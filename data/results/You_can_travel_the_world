You can travel the world

cross oceans
walk many roads
meet myriad souls
along the way
yet one day
a solitary moment
comes to be
stars align
a connection so true
so beautiful 
it brings tears 
to your eyes
the depth to which
he speaks to your heart 
will have you tongue tied
grasping for speech
for breath
and you will know
how eternal love is
and he is the only one
you want it with
