I think about you at both the odd and ordinary moments, 
for any, every and no reason at all.  
I might simply smell coffee brewing and remember that you took yours with 5 cream and 6 sugars -and how I always worried about how much sugar you took.  
The coffee alone is enough to cause my mind to wander to your sweet tooth, your love for donuts, 'turtle' chocolate caramel candies, and Kit Kats.  
I miss the most ridiculous things and still worry about the most ridiculous things.  And, sometimes at night when I'm trying to distract myself with a movie or a good book, lines spoken or read bring you full-force into my thoughts; then I am lost again, unable to enjoy the distraction, too steeped in my memories and in the pain of losing you.  
Time, it seems, is taking too long in helping to release me from thoughts of you.  At the very heart of it all, the very heart of me, I remember you, I worry about you, and I miss you.
RIP my sweet friend. Youre always on my heart.
