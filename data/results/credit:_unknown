More Than Comfort
There was more than comfort
there was safety there
in his embrace
his arms wrapped round her waist
And she was confident
in the sincerity of his care
the certainty
that within his heart
she held the foremost place
He gave her this
the confidence, comfort 
the trust, security
the love...
faith
