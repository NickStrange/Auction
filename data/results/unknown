Life
Life, when we let it, takes us where we're meant to go.  
We fight the flow at times, mistaking a detour for a dead-end.  
But it's just a different way we're suppose to go,
a different person we're suppose to meet, or say goodbye to.  
Detours and change happen.  Often.  Life knows what we don't know, and we simply have to trust it.
