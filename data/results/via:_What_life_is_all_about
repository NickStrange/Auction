Pulling on the soul
Envelop me
in the finer things
deep conversation
full of connectivity
purpose
the kind that helps another in need
warm smiles
ones that reach the eyes
hearts of gold
humanity
the lilting beauty 
of someones language
rolling off their tongue
fields of wildflowers
rains steady rhythmic thrum
handwritten letters
violins cord 
played passionately 
black and white photography
aged books
candlelit nights
time of olde
the classics
simple
yet captivating things
pulling on the soul
