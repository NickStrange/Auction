Woman-Made
The beauty I once had is gone.
There is a new kind in its place.  
It is mine, woman-made.
I created it from all the sorrows inside
and the unexpected treasures buried beneath.
I created it from all the love I have given
but never received.
I created it from every time I fell to my knees
and believed it a weakness,
but found in the end that it was strength.
I created it from the tears that would not flow,
from the coldness and bitterness
that threatened to overtake the warm.
I created it from the triumphs over pain,
the mountains I scaled
my bare hands gripping the earth and rocks.
I created it from what I believe
it should be made.
What people see now
is not what once showed upon my face
or graced the movements of my body.
What is seen now is what I pulled from life,
squeezed from life,
made from life.
Faint lines that caress my face
and the scattering of crescent scars,
slivered moons to light my way
all hint at the beauty of living, surviving, thriving
that is mine, woman-made.
