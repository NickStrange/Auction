How I Wanted
Oh my, how I wanted.
How angrily my blood screamed,
setting fire within me,
raging infernos through my veins.
I was forced to subdue my inclinations,
to hold back my wants,
to restrain.
But, oh my, how I wanted;
how I burned,
how eager I was for you
to reach for my hand
and lay claim to your daughter.
