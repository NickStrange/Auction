Missing my Father
I cannot recall the conversation.  
I only remember that it was heated, passionate, 
out of control.  
Words flew like knives.  
And for both of us our shields were down.  
We cut one another again and again.  
Our wounds, not the kind that heal. 

The words, spewed instead of spoken, 
were irretrievable, 
dark and ugly gifts we gave one another 
and could not return.  
I remember the emotions, 
the pain, the anger, 
the devastation from injury.

I remember the ringing in my ears 
from our voices raised in battle.  
War cries.  
But what breaks me is not being able to remember the conversation 
or what started it, 
what prompted such a damning escalation.  
It was our undoing, our end, 
and I cannot remember why.
