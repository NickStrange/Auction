via Walk the valley of shadows

The Silence and the Darkness
It was never the noise of thunder that frightened me
nor the blinding flash of light
no matter how fierce their rage
storms never crept fear into my bones
it was the silence and the darkness
when there was no obvious sign
of fit
fury
fire
that was the danger I knew to heed
the terror that slid under my skin
and kept me alert 
aware
afraid
in need
