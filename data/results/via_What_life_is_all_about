via What life is all about

Unique
I've never cared to be average or mainstream, popular or even obedient.  
I have always followed my own lead, my own rules, my own soul.  
I've moved where my spirit has moved me to go.  
I've listened, intently, and taken in the whole of the universe.  
I've absorbed nothing, filtered all.  
I've been vulnerable, too trusting in what I'd hoped was a good-hearted world.  
I've learned to be more guarded.  
I've never cared to fit into a mold made for spitting out copies.  
I've never cared that I was different.  
I've valued it.  
The looks, the barbs, the stones and bricks, the derision that people have thrown my way, I have used to build strength, to grow my character and tenacity.  
I have made fuel out of fire intended to burn me, using it instead to heat and spread my passions farther, wide.  
I have become more of who I am with every struggle, whether internal or given to me from the outside.  
I am grateful and proud to be unique, and to thrive when given challenges others expected would weaken both my heart and mind.
