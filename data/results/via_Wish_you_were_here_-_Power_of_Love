A Daughters Pain Let Go
After holding on ages too long
to bitterness
resentment
anger and pain
I felt the truth of the harm
the damage
the depletion and drain
to my own soul
that letting go brings.
It is a rotting, spoiling
festering thing.
It poisons and sickens
and it grows.
It holds power and sway
not over the my mother
but, over me
the one who cannot get away
who could not release the rage.
It is the truth
that I had become my own enemy 
and caused my own grief;
that I allowed her 
and all her evil
to continue to punish me.
It was not her
but, me
who had stolen my peace
And, until I let it go
I was the villain
the thief
of my own happiness.
